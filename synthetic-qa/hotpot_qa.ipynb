An additional, more entertainment-focused \"Thursday Night Football\" telecast (unrelated to the National Football League package of the same name, which aired on rival Sportsnet until 2016 but moved to TSN and sister network CTV Two in 2017) was added in 2015.\n","quest Who founded the company that sponsors the CFL game of the week? \n","truth Dave Thomas\n","pred dave thomas on\n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"stream","text":["\n"," 16%|█▌        | 1108/6935 [00:53<04:35, 21.13it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 16%|█▌        | 1111/6935 [00:53<04:39, 20.84it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 16%|█▌        | 1114/6935 [00:53<04:35, 21.14it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 16%|█▌        | 1117/6935 [00:53<04:37, 20.94it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 16%|█▌        | 1120/6935 [00:53<04:34, 21.17it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 16%|█▌        | 1123/6935 [00:53<04:31, 21.42it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 16%|█▌        | 1126/6935 [00:53<04:31, 21.43it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 16%|█▋        | 1129/6935 [00:54<04:31, 21.42it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 16%|█▋        | 1132/6935 [00:54<04:32, 21.32it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 16%|█▋        | 1135/6935 [00:54<04:41, 20.61it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 16%|█▋        | 1138/6935 [00:54<04:38, 20.79it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 16%|█▋        | 1141/6935 [00:54<04:39, 20.72it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 16%|█▋        | 1144/6935 [00:54<04:41, 20.56it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1147/6935 [00:54<04:35, 21.03it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1150/6935 [00:55<04:36, 20.91it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1153/6935 [00:55<04:36, 20.94it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1156/6935 [00:55<04:31, 21.27it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1159/6935 [00:55<04:50, 19.91it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1162/6935 [00:55<04:45, 20.25it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1165/6935 [00:55<04:38, 20.73it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1168/6935 [00:55<04:41, 20.52it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1171/6935 [00:56<04:37, 20.75it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1174/6935 [00:56<04:34, 21.00it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1177/6935 [00:56<04:31, 21.21it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1180/6935 [00:56<04:39, 20.56it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1183/6935 [00:56<04:42, 20.39it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1186/6935 [00:56<04:39, 20.55it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1189/6935 [00:56<04:34, 20.94it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1192/6935 [00:57<04:30, 21.23it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1195/6935 [00:57<04:28, 21.39it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1198/6935 [00:57<04:31, 21.11it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1201/6935 [00:57<04:33, 20.97it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1204/6935 [00:57<04:36, 20.69it/s]\u001b[A"],"name":"stderr"},{"output_type":"stream","text":["context Double Crossed was Jim Diamond's solo début album in 1985.

The design was very similar to that of the earlier \"Bajaj 150\" model (which was in turn based upon a Vespa 150 (VBA type) with a slightly modified body).\n","quest Who manufactured the scooter upon which the Bajaj Priya was based off of?\n","truth Piaggio\n","pred piaggio.\n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"stream","text":["\n"," 20%|██        | 1408/6935 [01:07<04:19, 21.33it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 20%|██        | 1411/6935 [01:07<04:17, 21.44it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 20%|██        | 1414/6935 [01:07<04:16, 21.55it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 20%|██        | 1417/6935 [01:07<04:19, 21.29it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 20%|██        | 1420/6935 [01:07<04:20, 21.14it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 21%|██        | 1423/6935 [01:07<04:18, 21.35it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 21%|██        | 1426/6935 [01:08<04:16, 21.49it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 21%|██        | 1429/6935 [01:08<04:19, 21.24it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 21%|██        | 1432/6935 [01:08<04:18, 21.25it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 21%|██        | 1435/6935 [01:08<04:21, 21.05it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 21%|██        | 1438/6935 [01:08<04:20, 21.10it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 21%|██        | 1441/6935 [01:08<04:20, 21.09it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 21%|██        | 1444/6935 [01:08<04:15, 21.51it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 21%|██        | 1447/6935 [01:09<04:13, 21.62it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 21%|██        | 1450/6935 [01:09<04:11, 21.82it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 21%|██        | 1453/6935 [01:09<04:13, 21.64it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 21%|██        | 1456/6935 [01:09<04:12, 21.70it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 21%|██        | 1459/6935 [01:09<04:21, 20.96it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 21%|██        | 1462/6935 [01:09<04:20, 21.00it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 21%|██        | 1465/6935 [01:09<04:16, 21.28it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 21%|██        | 1468/6935 [01:10<04:14, 21.48it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 21%|██        | 1471/6935 [01:10<04:14, 21.50it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 21%|██▏       | 1474/6935 [01:10<04:13, 21.56it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 21%|██▏       | 1477/6935 [01:10<04:16, 21.30it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 21%|██▏       | 1480/6935 [01:10<04:13, 21.54it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 21%|██▏       | 1483/6935 [01:10<04:15, 21.34it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 21%|██▏       | 1486/6935 [01:10<04:16, 21.21it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 21%|██▏       | 1489/6935 [01:11<04:13, 21.47it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1492/6935 [01:11<04:11, 21.67it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1495/6935 [01:11<04:12, 21.57it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1498/6935 [01:11<04:20, 20.89it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1501/6935 [01:11<04:16, 21.18it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1504/6935 [01:11<04:11, 21.64it/s]\u001b[A"],"name":"stderr"},{"output_type":"stream","text":["context Henry Gwyn Jeffreys Moseley (23 November 1887 – 10 August 1915) was an English physicist, whose contribution to the science of physics was the justification from physical laws of the previous empirical and chemical concept of the atomic number. This stemmed from his development of Moseley's law in X-ray spectra. Moseley's Law justified many concepts in chemistry by sorting the chemical elements of the periodic table of the elements in a logical order based on their physics. He published first the Long Form periodic table or Modern periodic table which is used till date.Thomas Henry Moray (August 28, 1892 - May 18, 1974) was an inventor from Salt Lake City, Utah. He received a US patent 2,460,707 in February 1949, after a process of 17 years in discussions with the patent office. The main components of the patent were an LC circuit resonator and a set of vacuum power tubes of diode type using uranium and radium power sources and doped germanium semiconductors on the cathodes. It was an early example of doped semiconductors and a forerunner of radioactive power supplies using radioactive isotopes in space research. Moray's device followed other work on nuclear batteries first done in 1913 by Henry Moseley using a radium source.\n","quest Thomas Henry Moray Followed work down on nuclear batteries in 1912 by this English physicist?\n","truth Henry Moseley\n","pred \n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"stream","text":["\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1507/6935 [01:11<04:15, 21.23it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1510/6935 [01:12<04:16, 21.14it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1513/6935 [01:12<04:13, 21.43it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1516/6935 [01:12<04:15, 21.21it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1519/6935 [01:12<04:22, 20.67it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1522/6935 [01:12<04:22, 20.62it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1525/6935 [01:12<04:16, 21.11it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1528/6935 [01:12<04:16, 21.09it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1531/6935 [01:13<04:13, 21.30it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1534/6935 [01:13<04:15, 21.14it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1537/6935 [01:13<04:18, 20.88it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1540/6935 [01:13<04:28, 20.06it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1543/6935 [01:13<04:26, 20.26it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1546/6935 [01:13<04:19, 20.73it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1549/6935 [01:13<04:19, 20.74it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1552/6935 [01:14<04:13, 21.22it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1555/6935 [01:14<04:14, 21.12it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1558/6935 [01:14<04:10, 21.43it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 23%|██▎       | 1561/6935 [01:14<04:11, 21.37it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 23%|██▎       | 1564/6935 [01:14<04:13, 21.21it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 23%|██▎       | 1567/6935 [01:14<04:07, 21.67it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 23%|██▎       | 1570/6935 [01:14<04:09, 21.52it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 23%|██▎       | 1573/6935 [01:15<04:07, 21.68it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 23%|██▎       | 1576/6935 [01:15<04:17, 20.79it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 23%|██▎       | 1579/6935 [01:15<04:14, 21.07it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 23%|██▎       | 1582/6935 [01:15<04:24, 20.25it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 23%|██▎       | 1585/6935 [01:15<04:23, 20.28it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 23%|██▎       | 1588/6935 [01:15<04:17, 20.74it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 23%|██▎       | 1591/6935 [01:15<04:18, 20.70it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 23%|██▎       | 1594/6935 [01:16<04:20, 20.47it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 23%|██▎       | 1597/6935 [01:16<04:16, 20.83it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 23%|██▎       | 1600/6935 [01:16<04:13, 21.05it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 23%|██▎       | 1603/6935 [01:16<04:16, 20.79it/s]\u001b[A"],"name":"stderr"},{"output_type":"stream","text":["context Asking Alexandria are an English rock band from York, North Yorkshire consisting of lead vocalist Danny Worsnop, guitarists Ben Bruce and Cameron Liddell, drummer James Cassells and bassist Sam Bettley.Killing You is a song by English Metalcore band Asking Alexandria.

The Shōgitai took a large part in the battles of the Boshin war, especially at the Battle of Toba-Fushimi, and the Battle of Ueno, where they were nearly exterminated.\n","quest The Shōgitai were an elite corps of which shogunate?\n","truth Tokugawa shogunate\n","pred the tokugawa shogunate ended\n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"stream","text":["\n"," 36%|███▌      | 2506/6935 [01:59<03:36, 20.47it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 36%|███▌      | 2509/6935 [02:00<03:33, 20.73it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 36%|███▌      | 2512/6935 [02:00<03:30, 21.03it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 36%|███▋      | 2515/6935 [02:00<03:31, 20.90it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 36%|███▋      | 2518/6935 [02:00<03:36, 20.41it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 36%|███▋      | 2521/6935 [02:00<03:35, 20.50it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 36%|███▋      | 2524/6935 [02:00<03:32, 20.73it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 36%|███▋      | 2527/6935 [02:00<03:29, 21.00it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 36%|███▋      | 2530/6935 [02:01<03:28, 21.15it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2533/6935 [02:01<03:30, 20.92it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2536/6935 [02:01<03:38, 20.11it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2539/6935 [02:01<03:33, 20.56it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2542/6935 [02:01<03:31, 20.73it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2545/6935 [02:01<03:28, 21.01it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2548/6935 [02:01<03:27, 21.17it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2551/6935 [02:02<03:32, 20.61it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2554/6935 [02:02<03:29, 20.88it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2557/6935 [02:02<03:26, 21.16it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2560/6935 [02:02<03:27, 21.08it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2563/6935 [02:02<03:31, 20.72it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2566/6935 [02:02<03:33, 20.46it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2569/6935 [02:02<03:32, 20.59it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2572/6935 [02:03<03:27, 21.00it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2575/6935 [02:03<03:28, 20.88it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2578/6935 [02:03<03:26, 21.15it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2581/6935 [02:03<03:45, 19.29it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2583/6935 [02:03<03:43, 19.45it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2586/6935 [02:03<03:38, 19.93it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2589/6935 [02:03<03:33, 20.33it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2592/6935 [02:04<03:29, 20.74it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2595/6935 [02:04<03:30, 20.61it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2598/6935 [02:04<03:34, 20.17it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 38%|███▊      | 2601/6935 [02:04<03:37, 19.91it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 38%|███▊      | 2604/6935 [02:04<03:36, 20.01it/s]\u001b[A"],"name":"stderr"},{"output_type":"stream","text":["context The Cleveland Browns season was the team's 64th season as a professional sports franchise and its 60th season as a member of the National Football League (NFL).

By 2014, coal mining had largely shifted to open pit mines in Wyoming, and there were only 60,000 active coal miners. The UMW was left with 35,000 members, of whom 20,000 were coal miners, chiefly in underground mines in Kentucky and West Virginia.

He was also a highly influential writer and chess theoretician.The concept of a world chess champion started to emerge in the first half of the 19th century, and the phrase \"world champion\" appeared in 1845. From this time onwards various players were \"acclaimed\" as world champions, but the first contest that was defined \"in advance\" as being for the world championship was the match between Steinitz and Zukertort in 1886. Until 1948 world championship contents were matches arranged privately between the players. As a result, the players also had to arrange the funding, in the form of stakes provided by enthusiasts who wished to bet on one of the players. In the early 20th century this was sometimes a barrier that prevent or delayed challenges for the title.\n","quest Which Austrian and later American chess master who was also a highly influential writer and chess theoretician competed for the first contest  that was defined \"in advance\" as being for the world championship?\n","truth Steinitz\n","pred wilhelm ( later william ) steinitz (\n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"stream","text":["\n"," 64%|██████▎   | 4407/6935 [03:33<02:22, 17.69it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▎   | 4409/6935 [03:33<02:18, 18.19it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▎   | 4411/6935 [03:34<02:26, 17.20it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▎   | 4414/6935 [03:34<02:18, 18.14it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▎   | 4417/6935 [03:34<02:12, 19.03it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▎   | 4419/6935 [03:34<02:11, 19.08it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▎   | 4421/6935 [03:34<02:11, 19.15it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4424/6935 [03:34<02:09, 19.38it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4426/6935 [03:34<02:08, 19.47it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4428/6935 [03:34<02:09, 19.31it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4430/6935 [03:35<02:08, 19.43it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4432/6935 [03:35<02:08, 19.45it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4434/6935 [03:35<02:09, 19.29it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4437/6935 [03:35<02:06, 19.73it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4439/6935 [03:35<02:15, 18.45it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4441/6935 [03:35<02:13, 18.68it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4444/6935 [03:35<02:09, 19.23it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4446/6935 [03:35<02:11, 18.91it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4449/6935 [03:36<02:06, 19.60it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4451/6935 [03:36<02:10, 19.09it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4454/6935 [03:36<02:06, 19.66it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4457/6935 [03:36<02:05, 19.67it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4459/6935 [03:36<02:16, 18.20it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4461/6935 [03:36<02:14, 18.44it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4463/6935 [03:36<02:13, 18.57it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4466/6935 [03:36<02:07, 19.30it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4469/6935 [03:37<02:03, 19.91it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4472/6935 [03:37<02:04, 19.81it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 65%|██████▍   | 4474/6935 [03:37<02:04, 19.76it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 65%|██████▍   | 4476/6935 [03:37<02:08, 19.14it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 65%|██████▍   | 4478/6935 [03:37<02:07, 19.26it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 65%|██████▍   | 4481/6935 [03:37<02:04, 19.79it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 65%|██████▍   | 4483/6935 [03:37<02:04, 19.62it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 65%|██████▍   | 4485/6935 [03:37<02:04, 19.68it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 65%|██████▍   | 4487/6935 [03:37<02:07, 19.13it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 65%|██████▍   | 4490/6935 [03:38<02:06, 19.35it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 65%|██████▍   | 4492/6935 [03:38<02:08, 19.07it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 65%|██████▍   | 4495/6935 [03:38<02:03, 19.81it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 65%|██████▍   | 4497/6935 [03:38<02:04, 19.59it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 65%|██████▍   | 4500/6935 [03:38<02:00, 20.14it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 65%|██████▍   | 4503/6935 [03:38<02:00, 20.18it/s]\u001b[A"],"name":"stderr"},{"output_type":"stream","text":["context Lantern Waste is a fictional place in \"The Chronicles of Narnia\" series by C.

The targets are filled with explosives at ranges from 375 to . Shooters are allowed to engage as many targets as they are able during the all-day event. Nearly every year the amount of explosives has increased; in 2004, the amount of explosives put out for people to shoot was greater than all of the other years combined. In 2005, new targets were introduced with smaller amounts of explosives to reduce window breakage in the surrounding countryside.

The group consists of singer/keyboardist Damon Albarn, guitarist/singer Graham Coxon, bassist Alex James and drummer Dave Rowntree. Their debut album \"Leisure\" (1991) incorporated the sounds of Madchester and shoegazing. Following a stylistic change influenced by English guitar pop groups such as the Kinks, the Beatles and XTC, Blur released \"Modern Life Is Rubbish\" (1993), \"Parklife\" (1994) and \"The Great Escape\" (1995). In the process, the band became central to the Britpop music and culture movement, and achieved mass popularity in the UK, aided by a chart battle with rivals Oasis in 1995 dubbed the \"Battle of Britpop\".Big Pig were an Australian funk, rock and pop band that existed from 1985 to 1991. An early line-up was Sherine on lead vocals and percussion (ex-Editions, Bang); Tony Antonaides on vocals and harmonica; Neil Baker on drums; Nick Disbray on vocals and percussion; Tim Rosewarne on vocals and keyboards (ex-Bang); Adrian Scaglione on drums; and Oleh Witer on vocals and percussion (ex-Bang).

He had an outwardly reserved character and did not court popularity either with his superiors or with the public. His American superior, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, wrote that he was \"blunt, at times to the point of rudeness\". In consequence he is less well known than many of his contemporaries.

The company moved its headquarters to Dublin, Ohio, on January 29, 2006. As of 2016, Wendy's was the world's third largest hamburger fast food chain with 6,500+ locations, following Burger King and McDonald's. On April 24, 2008, the company announced a merger with Triarc Companies Inc., a publicly traded company and the parent company of Arby's. Despite the new ownership, Wendy's headquarters remained in Dublin. Previously, Wendy's had rejected more than two buyout offers from Triarc. Following the merger, Triarc became known as Wendy's/Arby's Group, and later as The Wendy's Company.The CFL on TSN is TSN's presentation of the Canadian Football League.

The design was very similar to that of the earlier \"Bajaj 150\" model (which was in turn based upon a Vespa 150 (VBA type) with a slightly modified body).\n","quest Who manufactured the scooter upon which the Bajaj Priya was based off of?\n","truth Piaggio\n","pred piaggio.\n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"stream","text":["\n"," 20%|██        | 1406/6935 [01:12<04:50, 19.01it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 20%|██        | 1408/6935 [01:12<04:52, 18.88it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 20%|██        | 1410/6935 [01:12<04:53, 18.83it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 20%|██        | 1412/6935 [01:12<04:52, 18.88it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 20%|██        | 1415/6935 [01:13<04:42, 19.56it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 20%|██        | 1417/6935 [01:13<04:43, 19.48it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 20%|██        | 1419/6935 [01:13<04:48, 19.14it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 20%|██        | 1421/6935 [01:13<04:50, 18.99it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 21%|██        | 1423/6935 [01:13<04:48, 19.10it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 21%|██        | 1425/6935 [01:13<04:47, 19.16it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 21%|██        | 1428/6935 [01:13<04:39, 19.68it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 21%|██        | 1430/6935 [01:13<04:42, 19.46it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 21%|██        | 1432/6935 [01:14<04:45, 19.26it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 21%|██        | 1435/6935 [01:14<04:36, 19.87it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 21%|██        | 1437/6935 [01:14<04:43, 19.43it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 21%|██        | 1439/6935 [01:14<04:43, 19.39it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 21%|██        | 1441/6935 [01:14<04:41, 19.50it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 21%|██        | 1443/6935 [01:14<04:41, 19.50it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 21%|██        | 1445/6935 [01:14<04:41, 19.53it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 21%|██        | 1448/6935 [01:14<04:33, 20.05it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 21%|██        | 1451/6935 [01:14<04:50, 18.89it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 21%|██        | 1454/6935 [01:15<04:40, 19.56it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 21%|██        | 1456/6935 [01:15<04:46, 19.14it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 21%|██        | 1458/6935 [01:15<04:47, 19.05it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 21%|██        | 1460/6935 [01:15<04:45, 19.19it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 21%|██        | 1462/6935 [01:15<04:43, 19.30it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 21%|██        | 1464/6935 [01:15<04:43, 19.27it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 21%|██        | 1467/6935 [01:15<04:34, 19.92it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 21%|██        | 1469/6935 [01:15<04:40, 19.46it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 21%|██        | 1471/6935 [01:15<04:44, 19.23it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 21%|██        | 1473/6935 [01:16<04:43, 19.28it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 21%|██▏       | 1475/6935 [01:16<04:43, 19.24it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 21%|██▏       | 1477/6935 [01:16<04:51, 18.70it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 21%|██▏       | 1480/6935 [01:16<04:41, 19.40it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 21%|██▏       | 1483/6935 [01:16<04:31, 20.08it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 21%|██▏       | 1486/6935 [01:16<04:29, 20.20it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 21%|██▏       | 1489/6935 [01:16<04:37, 19.66it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 21%|██▏       | 1491/6935 [01:17<04:41, 19.34it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1493/6935 [01:17<04:47, 18.95it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1495/6935 [01:17<04:47, 18.92it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1497/6935 [01:17<04:48, 18.82it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1500/6935 [01:17<04:40, 19.40it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1503/6935 [01:17<04:32, 19.90it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1505/6935 [01:17<04:34, 19.82it/s]\u001b[A"],"name":"stderr"},{"output_type":"stream","text":["context Henry Gwyn Jeffreys Moseley (23 November 1887 – 10 August 1915) was an English physicist, whose contribution to the science of physics was the justification from physical laws of the previous empirical and chemical concept of the atomic number. This stemmed from his development of Moseley's law in X-ray spectra. Moseley's Law justified many concepts in chemistry by sorting the chemical elements of the periodic table of the elements in a logical order based on their physics. He published first the Long Form periodic table or Modern periodic table which is used till date.Thomas Henry Moray (August 28, 1892 - May 18, 1974) was an inventor from Salt Lake City, Utah. He received a US patent 2,460,707 in February 1949, after a process of 17 years in discussions with the patent office. The main components of the patent were an LC circuit resonator and a set of vacuum power tubes of diode type using uranium and radium power sources and doped germanium semiconductors on the cathodes. It was an early example of doped semiconductors and a forerunner of radioactive power supplies using radioactive isotopes in space research.

Mara and Mondrem were a hunting forest of the Norman Earls of Chester, established soon after 1071 by the first earl, Hugh d'Avranches. They might earlier have been an Anglo-Saxon hunting forest.

The Shōgitai took a large part in the battles of the Boshin war, especially at the Battle of Toba-Fushimi, and the Battle of Ueno, where they were nearly exterminated.\n","quest The Shōgitai were an elite corps of which shogunate?\n","truth Tokugawa shogunate\n","pred tokugawa shogunate ended\n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"stream","text":["\n"," 36%|███▌      | 2505/6935 [02:11<03:57, 18.67it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 36%|███▌      | 2507/6935 [02:11<03:53, 18.99it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 36%|███▌      | 2509/6935 [02:11<03:55, 18.80it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 36%|███▌      | 2511/6935 [02:11<04:07, 17.84it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 36%|███▌      | 2513/6935 [02:11<04:02, 18.25it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 36%|███▋      | 2516/6935 [02:11<03:51, 19.05it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 36%|███▋      | 2519/6935 [02:11<03:45, 19.55it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 36%|███▋      | 2521/6935 [02:12<03:46, 19.49it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 36%|███▋      | 2523/6935 [02:12<03:52, 18.99it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 36%|███▋      | 2525/6935 [02:12<03:51, 19.02it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 36%|███▋      | 2528/6935 [02:12<03:45, 19.52it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 36%|███▋      | 2530/6935 [02:12<03:49, 19.21it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2532/6935 [02:12<03:47, 19.38it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2534/6935 [02:12<03:48, 19.29it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2537/6935 [02:12<03:47, 19.30it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2539/6935 [02:12<03:48, 19.21it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2541/6935 [02:13<03:54, 18.72it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2543/6935 [02:13<04:09, 17.59it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2545/6935 [02:13<04:18, 16.96it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2547/6935 [02:13<04:09, 17.58it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2549/6935 [02:13<04:01, 18.17it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2551/6935 [02:13<03:59, 18.34it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2553/6935 [02:13<03:55, 18.62it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2555/6935 [02:13<03:51, 18.91it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2557/6935 [02:13<03:51, 18.89it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2559/6935 [02:14<03:53, 18.70it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2561/6935 [02:14<03:58, 18.32it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2563/6935 [02:14<03:54, 18.63it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2565/6935 [02:14<03:52, 18.76it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2567/6935 [02:14<03:49, 19.07it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2570/6935 [02:14<03:44, 19.45it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2572/6935 [02:14<03:45, 19.37it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2574/6935 [02:14<03:52, 18.78it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2576/6935 [02:15<03:54, 18.62it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2578/6935 [02:15<03:50, 18.91it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2580/6935 [02:15<03:57, 18.32it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2582/6935 [02:15<03:57, 18.35it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2584/6935 [02:15<03:55, 18.51it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2586/6935 [02:15<03:55, 18.46it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2589/6935 [02:15<03:46, 19.16it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2592/6935 [02:15<03:39, 19.75it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2594/6935 [02:15<03:42, 19.47it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2596/6935 [02:16<03:51, 18.74it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2598/6935 [02:16<03:53, 18.59it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2600/6935 [02:16<04:04, 17.73it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 38%|███▊      | 2602/6935 [02:16<04:02, 17.86it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 38%|███▊      | 2604/6935 [02:16<04:01, 17.96it/s]\u001b[A"],"name":"stderr"},{"output_type":"stream","text":["context The Cleveland Browns season was the team's 64th season as a professional sports franchise and its 60th season as a member of the National Football League (NFL).

Published in two volumes, in 1605 and 1615, \"Don Quixote\" is considered the most influential work of literature from the Spanish Golden Age and the entire Spanish literary canon. As a founding work of modern Western literature and one of the earliest canonical novels, it regularly appears high on lists of the greatest works of fiction ever published, such as the Bokklubben World Library collection that cites \"Don Quixote\" as the authors' choice for the \"best literary work ever written\".Alexander Gorsky (August 6, 1871 – 1924), a Russian ballet choreographer and a contemporary of Marius Petipa, is known for restaging Petipa’s classical ballets such as \"Swan Lake\", \"Don Quixote\", and \"The Nutcracker\". Gorsky “sought greater naturalism, realism, and characterization” in ballet. He valued acting skills over \"bravura\" technique ( a showy display of skills such as many turns or high jumps.) His interpretations of ballets were often controversial and he often used artists outside the dance world to create sets and costumes.\n","quest What Russian ballet choreographer restaged a play based on a Spanish novel by Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra? \n","truth Alexander Gorsky\n","pred alexander gorsky (\n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"stream","text":["\n"," 42%|████▏     | 2907/6935 [02:32<03:34, 18.78it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 42%|████▏     | 2909/6935 [02:32<03:32, 18.93it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 42%|████▏     | 2911/6935 [02:32<03:31, 19.06it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 42%|████▏     | 2913/6935 [02:32<03:37, 18.50it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 42%|████▏     | 2915/6935 [02:32<03:43, 18.00it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 42%|████▏     | 2917/6935 [02:33<03:51, 17.35it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 42%|████▏     | 2919/6935 [02:33<03:43, 17.99it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 42%|████▏     | 2922/6935 [02:33<03:33, 18.77it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 42%|████▏     | 2924/6935 [02:33<03:32, 18.84it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 42%|████▏     | 2926/6935 [02:33<03:33, 18.74it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 42%|████▏     | 2928/6935 [02:33<03:37, 18.42it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 42%|████▏     | 2930/6935 [02:33<03:35, 18.55it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 42%|████▏     | 2932/6935 [02:33<03:39, 18.24it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 42%|████▏     | 2934/6935 [02:33<03:37, 18.38it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 42%|████▏     | 2936/6935 [02:34<03:36, 18.49it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 42%|████▏     | 2938/6935 [02:34<03:34, 18.65it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 42%|████▏     | 2941/6935 [02:34<03:27, 19.23it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 42%|████▏     | 2943/6935 [02:34<03:30, 18.95it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 42%|████▏     | 2945/6935 [02:34<03:37, 18.34it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 42%|████▏     | 2947/6935 [02:34<03:37, 18.37it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2949/6935 [02:34<03:38, 18.28it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2951/6935 [02:34<03:45, 17.66it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2953/6935 [02:34<03:41, 17.96it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2955/6935 [02:35<03:38, 18.21it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2957/6935 [02:35<03:37, 18.32it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2959/6935 [02:35<03:35, 18.44it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2961/6935 [02:35<03:31, 18.78it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2963/6935 [02:35<03:32, 18.68it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2965/6935 [02:35<03:32, 18.67it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2967/6935 [02:35<03:43, 17.75it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2969/6935 [02:35<03:44, 17.63it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2971/6935 [02:35<03:46, 17.47it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2973/6935 [02:36<03:41, 17.86it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2975/6935 [02:36<03:36, 18.30it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2977/6935 [02:36<03:31, 18.73it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2980/6935 [02:36<03:23, 19.40it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2982/6935 [02:36<03:33, 18.50it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2984/6935 [02:36<03:31, 18.69it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2986/6935 [02:36<03:27, 19.00it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2989/6935 [02:36<03:24, 19.34it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2991/6935 [02:37<03:31, 18.63it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2993/6935 [02:37<03:27, 19.02it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2995/6935 [02:37<03:27, 18.95it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2997/6935 [02:37<03:26, 19.08it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2999/6935 [02:37<03:31, 18.61it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 3001/6935 [02:37<03:37, 18.05it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 3003/6935 [02:37<03:38, 17.98it/s]\u001b[A"],"name":"stderr"},{"output_type":"stream","text":["context Shrek 2 is a 2004 American computer-animated fantasy film produced by DreamWorks Animation and directed by Andrew Adamson, Kelly Asbury and Conrad Vernon.

He was murdered in 1969 by killers hired by a union political opponent, Mine Workers president Tony Boyle. His death led to significant reforms in the union.The United Mine Workers of America (UMW or UMWA) is a North American labor union best known for representing coal miners. Today, the Union also represents health care workers, truck drivers, manufacturing workers and public employees in the United States and Canada. Although its main focus has always been on workers and their rights, the UMW of today also advocates for better roads, schools, and universal health care.

He was also a highly influential writer and chess theoretician.The concept of a world chess champion started to emerge in the first half of the 19th century, and the phrase \"world champion\" appeared in 1845. From this time onwards various players were \"acclaimed\" as world champions, but the first contest that was defined \"in advance\" as being for the world championship was the match between Steinitz and Zukertort in 1886. Until 1948 world championship contents were matches arranged privately between the players. As a result, the players also had to arrange the funding, in the form of stakes provided by enthusiasts who wished to bet on one of the players. In the early 20th century this was sometimes a barrier that prevent or delayed challenges for the title.\n","quest Which Austrian and later American chess master who was also a highly influential writer and chess theoretician competed for the first contest  that was defined \"in advance\" as being for the world championship?\n","truth Steinitz\n","pred wilhelm ( later william ) steinitz (\n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"stream","text":["\n"," 64%|██████▎   | 4405/6935 [03:52<02:24, 17.56it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▎   | 4407/6935 [03:53<02:23, 17.63it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▎   | 4409/6935 [03:53<02:19, 18.05it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▎   | 4411/6935 [03:53<02:16, 18.45it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▎   | 4414/6935 [03:53<02:12, 19.09it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▎   | 4416/6935 [03:53<02:13, 18.88it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▎   | 4418/6935 [03:53<02:14, 18.65it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▎   | 4420/6935 [03:53<02:16, 18.45it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4422/6935 [03:53<02:17, 18.24it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4424/6935 [03:53<02:28, 16.96it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4426/6935 [03:54<02:24, 17.34it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4428/6935 [03:54<02:24, 17.33it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4430/6935 [03:54<02:21, 17.74it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4432/6935 [03:54<02:17, 18.25it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4434/6935 [03:54<02:16, 18.30it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4436/6935 [03:54<02:14, 18.60it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4438/6935 [03:54<02:16, 18.36it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4440/6935 [03:54<02:14, 18.52it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4442/6935 [03:54<02:15, 18.36it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4444/6935 [03:55<02:13, 18.70it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4446/6935 [03:55<02:12, 18.77it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4448/6935 [03:55<02:10, 19.09it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4450/6935 [03:55<02:11, 18.96it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4452/6935 [03:55<02:12, 18.81it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4454/6935 [03:55<02:11, 18.94it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4456/6935 [03:55<02:14, 18.48it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4458/6935 [03:55<02:16, 18.16it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4460/6935 [03:55<02:15, 18.33it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4462/6935 [03:56<02:14, 18.33it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4464/6935 [03:56<02:14, 18.33it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4466/6935 [03:56<02:13, 18.54it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4468/6935 [03:56<02:10, 18.86it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4470/6935 [03:56<02:10, 18.94it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4472/6935 [03:56<02:14, 18.31it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 65%|██████▍   | 4474/6935 [03:56<02:18, 17.80it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 65%|██████▍   | 4476/6935 [03:56<02:17, 17.89it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 65%|██████▍   | 4478/6935 [03:56<02:14, 18.33it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 65%|██████▍   | 4480/6935 [03:57<02:15, 18.14it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 65%|██████▍   | 4482/6935 [03:57<02:13, 18.41it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 65%|██████▍   | 4484/6935 [03:57<02:11, 18.68it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 65%|██████▍   | 4486/6935 [03:57<02:09, 18.87it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 65%|██████▍   | 4488/6935 [03:57<02:09, 18.94it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 65%|██████▍   | 4490/6935 [03:57<02:11, 18.55it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 65%|██████▍   | 4492/6935 [03:57<02:09, 18.86it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 65%|██████▍   | 4495/6935 [03:57<02:05, 19.39it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 65%|██████▍   | 4497/6935 [03:57<02:06, 19.28it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 65%|██████▍   | 4499/6935 [03:57<02:08, 18.96it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 65%|██████▍   | 4501/6935 [03:58<02:09, 18.81it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 65%|██████▍   | 4503/6935 [03:58<02:10, 18.60it/s]\u001b[A"],"name":"stderr"},{"output_type":"stream","text":["context Lantern Waste is a fictional place in \"The Chronicles of Narnia\" series by C.

He is close friends with Lucy Pevensie and is the first creature she meets in Narnia, as well as the first Narnian to be introduced in the series. Lewis said that the first Narnia story, \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\", all came to him from a single picture he had in his head of a faun carrying an umbrella and parcels through a snowy wood.

The targets are filled with explosives at ranges from 375 to . Shooters are allowed to engage as many targets as they are able during the all-day event. Nearly every year the amount of explosives has increased; in 2004, the amount of explosives put out for people to shoot was greater than all of the other years combined. In 2005, new targets were introduced with smaller amounts of explosives to reduce window breakage in the surrounding countryside. In recent years, the event has also featured an explosive fireball and an Anvil firing to start the event and entertain the participants.Anvil firing (also known in the USA as an \"anvil launching\" or an \"anvil shooting\") in the USA is the practice of firing an anvil into the air with gunpowder. In the UK this is where black powder is filled onto the top of the Anvil and ignited.

In the episode, to earn money for her husband Homer's snoring problem, Marge agrees to stay with her old prom date, Artie Ziff, for one weekend (on the grounds that he try not to grope her like he did in \"The Way We Was\"), but when Homer thinks Marge broke her promise, he runs away with Lenny to work on an oil rig.\"The Way We Was\" is the twelfth episode of \"The Simpsons\"<nowiki>'</nowiki> second season. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 31, 1991. In the episode, Marge tells the story of how she and Homer first met and fell in love. Flashing back to 1974, we see how Homer falls in love with Marge in high school and tries to get close to her by enlisting her as his French tutor.

The group consists of singer/keyboardist Damon Albarn, guitarist/singer Graham Coxon, bassist Alex James and drummer Dave Rowntree. Their debut album \"Leisure\" (1991) incorporated the sounds of Madchester and shoegazing. Following a stylistic change influenced by English guitar pop groups such as the Kinks, the Beatles and XTC, Blur released \"Modern Life Is Rubbish\" (1993), \"Parklife\" (1994) and \"The Great Escape\" (1995). In the process, the band became central to the Britpop music and culture movement, and achieved mass popularity in the UK, aided by a chart battle with rivals Oasis in 1995 dubbed the \"Battle of Britpop\".Big Pig were an Australian funk, rock and pop band that existed from 1985 to 1991.

He had an outwardly reserved character and did not court popularity either with his superiors or with the public. His American superior, General Dwight D.

He was raised in Dundas, Ontario, near Hamilton.

An additional, more entertainment-focused \"Thursday Night Football\" telecast (unrelated to the National Football League package of the same name, which aired on rival Sportsnet until 2016 but moved to TSN and sister network CTV Two in 2017) was added in 2015.\n","quest Who founded the company that sponsors the CFL game of the week? \n","truth Dave Thomas\n","pred dave thomas on\n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"stream","text":["\n"," 16%|█▌        | 1106/6935 [01:02<05:41, 17.06it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 16%|█▌        | 1108/6935 [01:02<05:37, 17.25it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 16%|█▌        | 1110/6935 [01:02<05:30, 17.63it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 16%|█▌        | 1112/6935 [01:03<05:25, 17.89it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 16%|█▌        | 1114/6935 [01:03<05:29, 17.67it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 16%|█▌        | 1116/6935 [01:03<05:35, 17.36it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 16%|█▌        | 1118/6935 [01:03<05:32, 17.48it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 16%|█▌        | 1120/6935 [01:03<05:32, 17.51it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 16%|█▌        | 1122/6935 [01:03<05:27, 17.75it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 16%|█▌        | 1124/6935 [01:03<05:31, 17.54it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 16%|█▌        | 1126/6935 [01:03<05:24, 17.92it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 16%|█▋        | 1128/6935 [01:03<05:26, 17.80it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 16%|█▋        | 1130/6935 [01:04<05:27, 17.74it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 16%|█▋        | 1132/6935 [01:04<05:30, 17.53it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 16%|█▋        | 1134/6935 [01:04<05:31, 17.49it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 16%|█▋        | 1136/6935 [01:04<05:33, 17.38it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 16%|█▋        | 1138/6935 [01:04<05:31, 17.50it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 16%|█▋        | 1140/6935 [01:04<05:27, 17.67it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 16%|█▋        | 1142/6935 [01:04<05:35, 17.26it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 16%|█▋        | 1144/6935 [01:04<05:27, 17.71it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1146/6935 [01:04<05:25, 17.77it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1148/6935 [01:05<05:32, 17.38it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1150/6935 [01:05<06:04, 15.86it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1152/6935 [01:05<06:11, 15.57it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1154/6935 [01:05<05:59, 16.06it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1156/6935 [01:05<05:48, 16.58it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1158/6935 [01:05<05:42, 16.87it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1160/6935 [01:05<05:40, 16.95it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1162/6935 [01:05<05:29, 17.51it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1164/6935 [01:06<05:23, 17.83it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1166/6935 [01:06<05:25, 17.70it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1168/6935 [01:06<05:44, 16.76it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1170/6935 [01:06<05:35, 17.19it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1172/6935 [01:06<05:27, 17.62it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1174/6935 [01:06<05:22, 17.86it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1176/6935 [01:06<05:19, 18.01it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1178/6935 [01:06<05:27, 17.58it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1180/6935 [01:06<05:20, 17.96it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1182/6935 [01:07<05:18, 18.07it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1184/6935 [01:07<05:18, 18.07it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1186/6935 [01:07<05:21, 17.87it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1188/6935 [01:07<05:24, 17.72it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1190/6935 [01:07<05:27, 17.56it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1192/6935 [01:07<05:22, 17.80it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1194/6935 [01:07<05:21, 17.83it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1196/6935 [01:07<05:29, 17.44it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1198/6935 [01:07<05:28, 17.45it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1200/6935 [01:08<05:47, 16.49it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1202/6935 [01:08<05:42, 16.74it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1204/6935 [01:08<05:40, 16.81it/s]\u001b[A"],"name":"stderr"},{"output_type":"stream","text":["context Double Crossed was Jim Diamond's solo début album in 1985.

It would be the team's fourth straight season where a top prospect of theirs would be sidelined for an entire season due to an injury (the 76ers previously dealt with former center Nerlens Noel being out in the 2013–14 NBA season and Joel Embiid being out for two straight seasons before this one). However, Joel Embiid, who was previously drafted 3rd in the 2014 draft, played in his first season after suffering multiple foot injuries before later being out for the rest of the season after playing a promising 31 games throughout the season. Also, it was the first season of draft and stash prospect Dario Šarić, who was also taken in the 2014 NBA draft.

This stemmed from his development of Moseley's law in X-ray spectra. Moseley's Law justified many concepts in chemistry by sorting the chemical elements of the periodic table of the elements in a logical order based on their physics. He published first the Long Form periodic table or Modern periodic table which is used till date.Thomas Henry Moray (August 28, 1892 - May 18, 1974) was an inventor from Salt Lake City, Utah. He received a US patent 2,460,707 in February 1949, after a process of 17 years in discussions with the patent office. The main components of the patent were an LC circuit resonator and a set of vacuum power tubes of diode type using uranium and radium power sources and doped germanium semiconductors on the cathodes. It was an early example of doped semiconductors and a forerunner of radioactive power supplies using radioactive isotopes in space research. Moray's device followed other work on nuclear batteries first done in 1913 by Henry Moseley using a radium source.\n","quest Thomas Henry Moray Followed work down on nuclear batteries in 1912 by this English physicist?\n","truth Henry Moseley\n","pred \n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"stream","text":["\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1506/6935 [01:25<05:11, 17.43it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1508/6935 [01:25<05:08, 17.61it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1510/6935 [01:25<05:06, 17.70it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1512/6935 [01:25<05:03, 17.89it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1514/6935 [01:26<04:58, 18.16it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1516/6935 [01:26<05:18, 17.03it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1518/6935 [01:26<05:28, 16.50it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1520/6935 [01:26<05:21, 16.84it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1522/6935 [01:26<05:19, 16.93it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1524/6935 [01:26<05:15, 17.14it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1526/6935 [01:26<05:11, 17.34it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1528/6935 [01:26<05:03, 17.79it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1530/6935 [01:27<05:14, 17.18it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1532/6935 [01:27<05:39, 15.94it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1534/6935 [01:27<05:33, 16.18it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1536/6935 [01:27<05:23, 16.70it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1538/6935 [01:27<05:13, 17.21it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1540/6935 [01:27<05:08, 17.49it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1542/6935 [01:27<05:05, 17.65it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1544/6935 [01:27<05:07, 17.55it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1546/6935 [01:27<05:03, 17.77it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1548/6935 [01:28<05:01, 17.87it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1550/6935 [01:28<05:04, 17.70it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1552/6935 [01:28<05:02, 17.77it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1554/6935 [01:28<05:01, 17.86it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1556/6935 [01:28<04:59, 17.94it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1558/6935 [01:28<05:02, 17.77it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1560/6935 [01:28<05:02, 17.76it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 23%|██▎       | 1562/6935 [01:28<05:04, 17.67it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 23%|██▎       | 1564/6935 [01:28<04:59, 17.91it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 23%|██▎       | 1566/6935 [01:29<04:58, 17.98it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 23%|██▎       | 1568/6935 [01:29<05:00, 17.85it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 23%|██▎       | 1570/6935 [01:29<05:15, 17.02it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 23%|██▎       | 1572/6935 [01:29<05:19, 16.76it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 23%|██▎       | 1574/6935 [01:29<05:37, 15.87it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 23%|██▎       | 1576/6935 [01:29<05:34, 16.03it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 23%|██▎       | 1578/6935 [01:29<05:34, 15.99it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 23%|██▎       | 1580/6935 [01:29<05:29, 16.26it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 23%|██▎       | 1582/6935 [01:30<05:23, 16.56it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 23%|██▎       | 1584/6935 [01:30<05:30, 16.21it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 23%|██▎       | 1586/6935 [01:30<05:21, 16.63it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 23%|██▎       | 1588/6935 [01:30<05:26, 16.38it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 23%|██▎       | 1590/6935 [01:30<05:12, 17.09it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 23%|██▎       | 1592/6935 [01:30<05:08, 17.31it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 23%|██▎       | 1594/6935 [01:30<05:14, 16.99it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 23%|██▎       | 1596/6935 [01:30<05:10, 17.17it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 23%|██▎       | 1598/6935 [01:30<05:03, 17.60it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 23%|██▎       | 1600/6935 [01:31<04:58, 17.89it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 23%|██▎       | 1602/6935 [01:31<05:04, 17.53it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 23%|██▎       | 1604/6935 [01:31<05:02, 17.60it/s]\u001b[A"],"name":"stderr"},{"output_type":"stream","text":["context Asking Alexandria are an English rock band from York, North Yorkshire consisting of lead vocalist Danny Worsnop, guitarists Ben Bruce and Cameron Liddell, drummer James Cassells and bassist Sam Bettley.Killing You is a song by English Metalcore band Asking Alexandria.

It is located around 9 miles south of Edinburgh, on the north bank of the North Esk, only a few hundred metres from the famous Rosslyn Chapel.\n","quest Where is Hawthornden Castle located relative to a castle 9 miles south of Edinburgh?\n","truth downstream\n","pred on the river north esk in\n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"stream","text":["\n"," 26%|██▌       | 1806/6935 [01:42<05:00, 17.07it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 26%|██▌       | 1808/6935 [01:42<04:54, 17.42it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 26%|██▌       | 1810/6935 [01:42<04:51, 17.57it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 26%|██▌       | 1812/6935 [01:43<04:48, 17.78it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 26%|██▌       | 1814/6935 [01:43<04:44, 17.98it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 26%|██▌       | 1816/6935 [01:43<04:49, 17.67it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 26%|██▌       | 1818/6935 [01:43<04:52, 17.47it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 26%|██▌       | 1820/6935 [01:43<04:45, 17.92it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 26%|██▋       | 1822/6935 [01:43<04:43, 18.06it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 26%|██▋       | 1824/6935 [01:43<04:44, 17.98it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 26%|██▋       | 1826/6935 [01:43<04:45, 17.91it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 26%|██▋       | 1828/6935 [01:44<04:48, 17.71it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 26%|██▋       | 1830/6935 [01:44<04:45, 17.89it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 26%|██▋       | 1832/6935 [01:44<04:40, 18.17it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 26%|██▋       | 1834/6935 [01:44<04:39, 18.28it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 26%|██▋       | 1836/6935 [01:44<04:47, 17.73it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 27%|██▋       | 1838/6935 [01:44<04:48, 17.70it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 27%|██▋       | 1840/6935 [01:44<04:54, 17.29it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 27%|██▋       | 1842/6935 [01:44<05:03, 16.79it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 27%|██▋       | 1844/6935 [01:44<05:00, 16.93it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 27%|██▋       | 1846/6935 [01:45<04:49, 17.58it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 27%|██▋       | 1848/6935 [01:45<04:47, 17.68it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 27%|██▋       | 1850/6935 [01:45<04:45, 17.84it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 27%|██▋       | 1852/6935 [01:45<04:41, 18.05it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 27%|██▋       | 1854/6935 [01:45<04:45, 17.77it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 27%|██▋       | 1856/6935 [01:45<04:47, 17.66it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 27%|██▋       | 1858/6935 [01:45<04:51, 17.42it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 27%|██▋       | 1860/6935 [01:45<04:48, 17.57it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 27%|██▋       | 1862/6935 [01:45<04:48, 17.61it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 27%|██▋       | 1864/6935 [01:46<04:44, 17.83it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 27%|██▋       | 1866/6935 [01:46<04:38, 18.23it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 27%|██▋       | 1868/6935 [01:46<04:43, 17.89it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 27%|██▋       | 1870/6935 [01:46<04:53, 17.28it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 27%|██▋       | 1872/6935 [01:46<04:58, 16.94it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 27%|██▋       | 1874/6935 [01:46<04:56, 17.08it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 27%|██▋       | 1876/6935 [01:46<04:50, 17.44it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 27%|██▋       | 1878/6935 [01:46<04:54, 17.20it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 27%|██▋       | 1880/6935 [01:46<04:53, 17.21it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 27%|██▋       | 1882/6935 [01:47<04:49, 17.48it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 27%|██▋       | 1884/6935 [01:47<04:49, 17.45it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 27%|██▋       | 1886/6935 [01:47<04:58, 16.94it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 27%|██▋       | 1888/6935 [01:47<04:59, 16.84it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 27%|██▋       | 1890/6935 [01:47<04:50, 17.36it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 27%|██▋       | 1892/6935 [01:47<04:53, 17.15it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 27%|██▋       | 1894/6935 [01:47<04:57, 16.96it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 27%|██▋       | 1896/6935 [01:47<05:00, 16.78it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 27%|██▋       | 1898/6935 [01:48<04:53, 17.17it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 27%|██▋       | 1900/6935 [01:48<04:45, 17.61it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 27%|██▋       | 1902/6935 [01:48<04:41, 17.87it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 27%|██▋       | 1904/6935 [01:48<04:46, 17.55it/s]\u001b[A"],"name":"stderr"},{"output_type":"stream","text":["context Mary O'Connell (better known as Sister Anthony, S.C.)

Mara and Mondrem were a hunting forest of the Norman Earls of Chester, established soon after 1071 by the first earl, Hugh d'Avranches. They might earlier have been an Anglo-Saxon hunting forest.

The Shōgitai took a large part in the battles of the Boshin war, especially at the Battle of Toba-Fushimi, and the Battle of Ueno, where they were nearly exterminated.\n","quest The Shōgitai were an elite corps of which shogunate?\n","truth Tokugawa shogunate\n","pred tokugawa shogunate ended\n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"stream","text":["\n"," 36%|███▌      | 2506/6935 [02:23<04:25, 16.68it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 36%|███▌      | 2508/6935 [02:23<04:20, 17.02it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 36%|███▌      | 2510/6935 [02:23<04:16, 17.23it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 36%|███▌      | 2512/6935 [02:23<04:15, 17.28it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 36%|███▋      | 2514/6935 [02:23<04:11, 17.56it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 36%|███▋      | 2516/6935 [02:23<04:11, 17.59it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 36%|███▋      | 2518/6935 [02:23<04:07, 17.81it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 36%|███▋      | 2520/6935 [02:24<04:10, 17.62it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 36%|███▋      | 2522/6935 [02:24<04:18, 17.09it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 36%|███▋      | 2524/6935 [02:24<04:24, 16.68it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 36%|███▋      | 2526/6935 [02:24<04:23, 16.75it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 36%|███▋      | 2528/6935 [02:24<04:21, 16.88it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 36%|███▋      | 2530/6935 [02:24<04:16, 17.19it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2532/6935 [02:24<04:14, 17.29it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2534/6935 [02:24<04:09, 17.64it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2536/6935 [02:25<04:06, 17.81it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2538/6935 [02:25<04:20, 16.86it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2540/6935 [02:25<04:24, 16.64it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2542/6935 [02:25<04:21, 16.82it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2544/6935 [02:25<04:17, 17.08it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2546/6935 [02:25<04:11, 17.47it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2548/6935 [02:25<04:12, 17.36it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2550/6935 [02:25<04:10, 17.53it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2552/6935 [02:25<04:06, 17.78it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2554/6935 [02:26<04:05, 17.85it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2556/6935 [02:26<04:12, 17.34it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2558/6935 [02:26<04:10, 17.50it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2560/6935 [02:26<04:10, 17.46it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2562/6935 [02:26<04:11, 17.42it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2564/6935 [02:26<04:13, 17.27it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2566/6935 [02:26<04:11, 17.38it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2568/6935 [02:26<04:05, 17.78it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2570/6935 [02:26<04:09, 17.52it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2572/6935 [02:27<04:09, 17.46it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2574/6935 [02:27<04:18, 16.85it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2576/6935 [02:27<04:22, 16.58it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2578/6935 [02:27<04:18, 16.83it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2580/6935 [02:27<04:13, 17.21it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2582/6935 [02:27<04:09, 17.41it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2584/6935 [02:27<04:10, 17.38it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2586/6935 [02:27<04:10, 17.34it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2588/6935 [02:28<04:07, 17.57it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2590/6935 [02:28<04:03, 17.82it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2592/6935 [02:28<04:15, 17.01it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2594/6935 [02:28<04:08, 17.44it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2596/6935 [02:28<04:10, 17.32it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2598/6935 [02:28<04:07, 17.52it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2600/6935 [02:28<04:03, 17.83it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 38%|███▊      | 2602/6935 [02:28<04:01, 17.97it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 38%|███▊      | 2604/6935 [02:28<04:00, 18.01it/s]\u001b[A"],"name":"stderr"},{"output_type":"stream","text":["context The Cleveland Browns season was the team's 64th season as a professional sports franchise and its 60th season as a member of the National Football League (NFL).

Published in two volumes, in 1605 and 1615, \"Don Quixote\" is considered the most influential work of literature from the Spanish Golden Age and the entire Spanish literary canon. As a founding work of modern Western literature and one of the earliest canonical novels, it regularly appears high on lists of the greatest works of fiction ever published, such as the Bokklubben World Library collection that cites \"Don Quixote\" as the authors' choice for the \"best literary work ever written\".Alexander Gorsky (August 6, 1871 – 1924), a Russian ballet choreographer and a contemporary of Marius Petipa, is known for restaging Petipa’s classical ballets such as \"Swan Lake\", \"Don Quixote\", and \"The Nutcracker\". Gorsky “sought greater naturalism, realism, and characterization” in ballet. He valued acting skills over \"bravura\" technique ( a showy display of skills such as many turns or high jumps.) His interpretations of ballets were often controversial and he often used artists outside the dance world to create sets and costumes.\n","quest What Russian ballet choreographer restaged a play based on a Spanish novel by Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra? \n","truth Alexander Gorsky\n","pred alexander gorsky (\n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"stream","text":["\n"," 42%|████▏     | 2906/6935 [02:46<04:02, 16.60it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 42%|████▏     | 2908/6935 [02:46<03:54, 17.20it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 42%|████▏     | 2910/6935 [02:46<03:55, 17.08it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 42%|████▏     | 2912/6935 [02:46<03:49, 17.54it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 42%|████▏     | 2914/6935 [02:46<03:45, 17.80it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 42%|████▏     | 2916/6935 [02:46<03:43, 17.96it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 42%|████▏     | 2918/6935 [02:47<03:45, 17.80it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 42%|████▏     | 2920/6935 [02:47<03:42, 18.05it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 42%|████▏     | 2922/6935 [02:47<03:42, 18.02it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 42%|████▏     | 2924/6935 [02:47<03:42, 18.06it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 42%|████▏     | 2926/6935 [02:47<03:38, 18.39it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 42%|████▏     | 2928/6935 [02:47<03:44, 17.86it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 42%|████▏     | 2930/6935 [02:47<03:44, 17.85it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 42%|████▏     | 2932/6935 [02:47<03:42, 17.98it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 42%|████▏     | 2934/6935 [02:47<03:44, 17.85it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 42%|████▏     | 2936/6935 [02:48<03:43, 17.88it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 42%|████▏     | 2938/6935 [02:48<03:38, 18.29it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 42%|████▏     | 2940/6935 [02:48<03:41, 18.05it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 42%|████▏     | 2942/6935 [02:48<03:45, 17.69it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 42%|████▏     | 2944/6935 [02:48<03:50, 17.33it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 42%|████▏     | 2946/6935 [02:48<03:54, 16.99it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2948/6935 [02:48<03:47, 17.56it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2950/6935 [02:48<03:49, 17.37it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2952/6935 [02:48<03:46, 17.61it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2954/6935 [02:49<03:43, 17.79it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2956/6935 [02:49<03:49, 17.31it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2958/6935 [02:49<03:47, 17.47it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2960/6935 [02:49<03:50, 17.22it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2962/6935 [02:49<03:46, 17.56it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2964/6935 [02:49<03:47, 17.44it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2966/6935 [02:49<03:46, 17.54it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2968/6935 [02:49<03:43, 17.75it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2970/6935 [02:49<03:43, 17.76it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2972/6935 [02:50<03:40, 17.94it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2974/6935 [02:50<03:40, 17.96it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2976/6935 [02:50<03:52, 17.03it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2978/6935 [02:50<03:47, 17.37it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2980/6935 [02:50<03:43, 17.71it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2982/6935 [02:50<03:52, 17.03it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2984/6935 [02:50<03:51, 17.07it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2986/6935 [02:50<03:50, 17.12it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2988/6935 [02:51<03:45, 17.51it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2990/6935 [02:51<03:42, 17.75it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2992/6935 [02:51<03:39, 17.95it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2994/6935 [02:51<03:44, 17.54it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2996/6935 [02:51<03:50, 17.11it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2998/6935 [02:51<04:03, 16.16it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 3000/6935 [02:51<03:57, 16.54it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 3002/6935 [02:51<03:50, 17.04it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 3004/6935 [02:51<03:47, 17.24it/s]\u001b[A"],"name":"stderr"},{"output_type":"stream","text":["context Shrek 2 is a 2004 American computer-animated fantasy film produced by DreamWorks Animation and directed by Andrew Adamson, Kelly Asbury and Conrad Vernon.

He was murdered in 1969 by killers hired by a union political opponent, Mine Workers president Tony Boyle. His death led to significant reforms in the union.The United Mine Workers of America (UMW or UMWA) is a North American labor union best known for representing coal miners. Today, the Union also represents health care workers, truck drivers, manufacturing workers and public employees in the United States and Canada. Although its main focus has always been on workers and their rights, the UMW of today also advocates for better roads, schools, and universal health care.

He was also a highly influential writer and chess theoretician.The concept of a world chess champion started to emerge in the first half of the 19th century, and the phrase \"world champion\" appeared in 1845. From this time onwards various players were \"acclaimed\" as world champions, but the first contest that was defined \"in advance\" as being for the world championship was the match between Steinitz and Zukertort in 1886. Until 1948 world championship contents were matches arranged privately between the players. As a result, the players also had to arrange the funding, in the form of stakes provided by enthusiasts who wished to bet on one of the players. In the early 20th century this was sometimes a barrier that prevent or delayed challenges for the title.\n","quest Which Austrian and later American chess master who was also a highly influential writer and chess theoretician competed for the first contest  that was defined \"in advance\" as being for the world championship?\n","truth Steinitz\n","pred wilhelm ( later william ) steinitz (\n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"stream","text":["\n"," 64%|██████▎   | 4406/6935 [04:14<02:40, 15.78it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▎   | 4408/6935 [04:14<02:47, 15.07it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▎   | 4410/6935 [04:14<02:51, 14.73it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▎   | 4412/6935 [04:14<02:54, 14.47it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▎   | 4414/6935 [04:14<02:52, 14.59it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▎   | 4416/6935 [04:14<02:51, 14.72it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▎   | 4418/6935 [04:14<02:51, 14.71it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▎   | 4420/6935 [04:14<02:49, 14.85it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4422/6935 [04:15<02:48, 14.89it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4424/6935 [04:15<02:48, 14.89it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4426/6935 [04:15<02:44, 15.26it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4428/6935 [04:15<02:44, 15.24it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4430/6935 [04:15<02:42, 15.46it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4432/6935 [04:15<02:41, 15.54it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4434/6935 [04:15<02:41, 15.50it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4436/6935 [04:16<02:42, 15.39it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4438/6935 [04:16<02:39, 15.63it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4440/6935 [04:16<02:37, 15.84it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4442/6935 [04:16<02:35, 16.00it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4444/6935 [04:16<02:32, 16.28it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4446/6935 [04:16<02:30, 16.49it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4448/6935 [04:16<02:28, 16.78it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4450/6935 [04:16<02:27, 16.85it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4452/6935 [04:16<02:26, 16.99it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4454/6935 [04:17<02:24, 17.17it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4456/6935 [04:17<02:28, 16.69it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4458/6935 [04:17<02:28, 16.67it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4460/6935 [04:17<02:32, 16.20it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4462/6935 [04:17<02:31, 16.37it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4464/6935 [04:17<02:31, 16.30it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4466/6935 [04:17<02:29, 16.53it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4468/6935 [04:17<02:27, 16.68it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4470/6935 [04:18<02:25, 16.95it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4472/6935 [04:18<02:25, 16.98it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 65%|██████▍   | 4474/6935 [04:18<02:31, 16.25it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 65%|██████▍   | 4476/6935 [04:18<02:31, 16.25it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 65%|██████▍   | 4478/6935 [04:18<02:27, 16.67it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 65%|██████▍   | 4480/6935 [04:18<02:32, 16.09it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 65%|██████▍   | 4482/6935 [04:18<02:31, 16.16it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 65%|██████▍   | 4484/6935 [04:18<02:31, 16.22it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 65%|██████▍   | 4486/6935 [04:19<02:28, 16.45it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 65%|██████▍   | 4488/6935 [04:19<02:25, 16.77it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 65%|██████▍   | 4490/6935 [04:19<02:28, 16.43it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 65%|██████▍   | 4492/6935 [04:19<02:28, 16.48it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 65%|██████▍   | 4494/6935 [04:19<02:25, 16.75it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 65%|██████▍   | 4496/6935 [04:19<02:24, 16.91it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 65%|██████▍   | 4498/6935 [04:19<02:26, 16.64it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 65%|██████▍   | 4500/6935 [04:19<02:25, 16.75it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 65%|██████▍   | 4502/6935 [04:19<02:26, 16.62it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 65%|██████▍   | 4504/6935 [04:20<02:31, 16.02it/s]\u001b[A"],"name":"stderr"},{"output_type":"stream","text":["context Lantern Waste is a fictional place in \"The Chronicles of Narnia\" series by C.

The lamppost in the wood is an iconic image of Narnia, and the question of its origin is what convinced Lewis to write more than one book on Narnia. One of King Edmund's titles is \"Duke of Lantern Waste\".Tumnus is a fictional character in C. S. Lewis' series \"The Chronicles of Narnia\". He is featured prominently in \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\" and also appears in \"The Horse and His Boy\" and \"The Last Battle\". He is close friends with Lucy Pevensie and is the first creature she meets in Narnia, as well as the first Narnian to be introduced in the series. Lewis said that the first Narnia story, \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\", all came to him from a single picture he had in his head of a faun carrying an umbrella and parcels through a snowy wood.

The targets are filled with explosives at ranges from 375 to . Shooters are allowed to engage as many targets as they are able during the all-day event. Nearly every year the amount of explosives has increased; in 2004, the amount of explosives put out for people to shoot was greater than all of the other years combined. In 2005, new targets were introduced with smaller amounts of explosives to reduce window breakage in the surrounding countryside. In recent years, the event has also featured an explosive fireball and an Anvil firing to start the event and entertain the participants.Anvil firing (also known in the USA as an \"anvil launching\" or an \"anvil shooting\") in the USA is the practice of firing an anvil into the air with gunpowder. In the UK this is where black powder is filled onto the top of the Anvil and ignited.

In the episode, to earn money for her husband Homer's snoring problem, Marge agrees to stay with her old prom date, Artie Ziff, for one weekend (on the grounds that he try not to grope her like he did in \"The Way We Was\"), but when Homer thinks Marge broke her promise, he runs away with Lenny to work on an oil rig.\"The Way We Was\" is the twelfth episode of \"The Simpsons\"<nowiki>'</nowiki> second season. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 31, 1991. In the episode, Marge tells the story of how she and Homer first met and fell in love. Flashing back to 1974, we see how Homer falls in love with Marge in high school and tries to get close to her by enlisting her as his French tutor.

The group consists of singer/keyboardist Damon Albarn, guitarist/singer Graham Coxon, bassist Alex James and drummer Dave Rowntree. Their debut album \"Leisure\" (1991) incorporated the sounds of Madchester and shoegazing. Following a stylistic change influenced by English guitar pop groups such as the Kinks, the Beatles and XTC, Blur released \"Modern Life Is Rubbish\" (1993), \"Parklife\" (1994) and \"The Great Escape\" (1995). In the process, the band became central to the Britpop music and culture movement, and achieved mass popularity in the UK, aided by a chart battle with rivals Oasis in 1995 dubbed the \"Battle of Britpop\".Big Pig were an Australian funk, rock and pop band that existed from 1985 to 1991.

He had an outwardly reserved character and did not court popularity either with his superiors or with the public. His American superior, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, wrote that he was \"blunt, at times to the point of rudeness\". In consequence he is less well known than many of his contemporaries.

An additional, more entertainment-focused \"Thursday Night Football\" telecast (unrelated to the National Football League package of the same name, which aired on rival Sportsnet until 2016 but moved to TSN and sister network CTV Two in 2017) was added in 2015.\n","quest Who founded the company that sponsors the CFL game of the week? \n","truth Dave Thomas\n","pred dave thomas on\n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"stream","text":["\n"," 16%|█▌        | 1106/6935 [01:06<05:50, 16.65it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 16%|█▌        | 1108/6935 [01:06<05:57, 16.29it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 16%|█▌        | 1110/6935 [01:06<05:49, 16.67it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 16%|█▌        | 1112/6935 [01:06<05:41, 17.07it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 16%|█▌        | 1114/6935 [01:06<05:45, 16.84it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 16%|█▌        | 1116/6935 [01:07<05:41, 17.03it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 16%|█▌        | 1118/6935 [01:07<05:45, 16.84it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 16%|█▌        | 1120/6935 [01:07<05:40, 17.09it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 16%|█▌        | 1122/6935 [01:07<05:35, 17.30it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 16%|█▌        | 1124/6935 [01:07<05:42, 16.97it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 16%|█▌        | 1126/6935 [01:07<05:48, 16.67it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 16%|█▋        | 1128/6935 [01:07<05:48, 16.64it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 16%|█▋        | 1130/6935 [01:07<05:43, 16.89it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 16%|█▋        | 1132/6935 [01:08<05:43, 16.91it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 16%|█▋        | 1134/6935 [01:08<05:38, 17.16it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 16%|█▋        | 1136/6935 [01:08<05:37, 17.19it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 16%|█▋        | 1138/6935 [01:08<05:43, 16.90it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 16%|█▋        | 1140/6935 [01:08<05:53, 16.40it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 16%|█▋        | 1142/6935 [01:08<05:52, 16.43it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 16%|█▋        | 1144/6935 [01:08<05:50, 16.54it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1146/6935 [01:08<06:07, 15.74it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1148/6935 [01:08<06:06, 15.79it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1150/6935 [01:09<06:04, 15.88it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1152/6935 [01:09<05:57, 16.17it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1154/6935 [01:09<05:52, 16.38it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1156/6935 [01:09<05:42, 16.85it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1158/6935 [01:09<05:57, 16.15it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1160/6935 [01:09<05:58, 16.12it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1162/6935 [01:09<05:49, 16.52it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1164/6935 [01:09<05:47, 16.61it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1166/6935 [01:10<05:38, 17.06it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1168/6935 [01:10<05:34, 17.24it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1170/6935 [01:10<05:49, 16.48it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1172/6935 [01:10<05:52, 16.36it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1174/6935 [01:10<05:46, 16.64it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1176/6935 [01:10<05:50, 16.45it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1178/6935 [01:10<05:42, 16.80it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1180/6935 [01:10<05:44, 16.72it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1182/6935 [01:11<05:41, 16.85it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1184/6935 [01:11<05:39, 16.94it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1186/6935 [01:11<05:35, 17.15it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1188/6935 [01:11<05:30, 17.37it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1190/6935 [01:11<05:48, 16.50it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1192/6935 [01:11<05:50, 16.38it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1194/6935 [01:11<05:48, 16.47it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1196/6935 [01:11<05:53, 16.24it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1198/6935 [01:12<05:54, 16.20it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1200/6935 [01:12<05:52, 16.27it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1202/6935 [01:12<05:45, 16.59it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 17%|█▋        | 1204/6935 [01:12<05:39, 16.88it/s]\u001b[A"],"name":"stderr"},{"output_type":"stream","text":["context Double Crossed was Jim Diamond's solo début album in 1985.

It would be the team's fourth straight season where a top prospect of theirs would be sidelined for an entire season due to an injury (the 76ers previously dealt with former center Nerlens Noel being out in the 2013–14 NBA season and Joel Embiid being out for two straight seasons before this one). However, Joel Embiid, who was previously drafted 3rd in the 2014 draft, played in his first season after suffering multiple foot injuries before later being out for the rest of the season after playing a promising 31 games throughout the season. Also, it was the first season of draft and stash prospect Dario Šarić, who was also taken in the 2014 NBA draft.

This stemmed from his development of Moseley's law in X-ray spectra. Moseley's Law justified many concepts in chemistry by sorting the chemical elements of the periodic table of the elements in a logical order based on their physics. He published first the Long Form periodic table or Modern periodic table which is used till date.Thomas Henry Moray (August 28, 1892 - May 18, 1974) was an inventor from Salt Lake City, Utah. He received a US patent 2,460,707 in February 1949, after a process of 17 years in discussions with the patent office. The main components of the patent were an LC circuit resonator and a set of vacuum power tubes of diode type using uranium and radium power sources and doped germanium semiconductors on the cathodes. It was an early example of doped semiconductors and a forerunner of radioactive power supplies using radioactive isotopes in space research. Moray's device followed other work on nuclear batteries first done in 1913 by Henry Moseley using a radium source.\n","quest Thomas Henry Moray Followed work down on nuclear batteries in 1912 by this English physicist?\n","truth Henry Moseley\n","pred henry gwyn jeffreys moseley (\n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"stream","text":["\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1506/6935 [01:30<05:33, 16.26it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1508/6935 [01:30<05:29, 16.48it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1510/6935 [01:30<05:23, 16.78it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1512/6935 [01:30<05:20, 16.94it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1514/6935 [01:30<05:16, 17.13it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1516/6935 [01:31<05:20, 16.91it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1518/6935 [01:31<05:15, 17.16it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1520/6935 [01:31<05:17, 17.04it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1522/6935 [01:31<05:27, 16.55it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1524/6935 [01:31<05:26, 16.59it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1526/6935 [01:31<05:25, 16.63it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1528/6935 [01:31<05:20, 16.85it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1530/6935 [01:31<05:18, 16.98it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1532/6935 [01:32<05:22, 16.76it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1534/6935 [01:32<05:29, 16.39it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1536/6935 [01:32<05:35, 16.08it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1538/6935 [01:32<05:30, 16.32it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1540/6935 [01:32<05:26, 16.52it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1542/6935 [01:32<05:23, 16.68it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1544/6935 [01:32<05:22, 16.71it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1546/6935 [01:32<05:24, 16.62it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1548/6935 [01:33<05:28, 16.40it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1550/6935 [01:33<05:29, 16.33it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1552/6935 [01:33<05:36, 16.02it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1554/6935 [01:33<05:31, 16.23it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1556/6935 [01:33<05:30, 16.27it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1558/6935 [01:33<05:28, 16.37it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 22%|██▏       | 1560/6935 [01:33<05:27, 16.40it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 23%|██▎       | 1562/6935 [01:33<05:23, 16.59it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 23%|██▎       | 1564/6935 [01:33<05:20, 16.77it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 23%|██▎       | 1566/6935 [01:34<05:19, 16.80it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 23%|██▎       | 1568/6935 [01:34<05:19, 16.80it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 23%|██▎       | 1570/6935 [01:34<05:25, 16.50it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 23%|██▎       | 1572/6935 [01:34<05:34, 16.04it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 23%|██▎       | 1574/6935 [01:34<05:44, 15.56it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 23%|██▎       | 1576/6935 [01:34<05:33, 16.09it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 23%|██▎       | 1578/6935 [01:34<05:30, 16.22it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 23%|██▎       | 1580/6935 [01:34<05:25, 16.46it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 23%|██▎       | 1582/6935 [01:35<05:22, 16.59it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 23%|██▎       | 1584/6935 [01:35<05:17, 16.86it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 23%|██▎       | 1586/6935 [01:35<05:22, 16.56it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 23%|██▎       | 1588/6935 [01:35<05:19, 16.72it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 23%|██▎       | 1590/6935 [01:35<05:20, 16.68it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 23%|██▎       | 1592/6935 [01:35<05:15, 16.92it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 23%|██▎       | 1594/6935 [01:35<05:21, 16.63it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 23%|██▎       | 1596/6935 [01:35<05:16, 16.86it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 23%|██▎       | 1598/6935 [01:36<05:17, 16.82it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 23%|██▎       | 1600/6935 [01:36<05:24, 16.43it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 23%|██▎       | 1602/6935 [01:36<05:36, 15.83it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 23%|██▎       | 1604/6935 [01:36<05:36, 15.84it/s]\u001b[A"],"name":"stderr"},{"output_type":"stream","text":["context Asking Alexandria are an English rock band from York, North Yorkshire consisting of lead vocalist Danny Worsnop, guitarists Ben Bruce and Cameron Liddell, drummer James Cassells and bassist Sam Bettley.Killing You is a song by English Metalcore band Asking Alexandria.

Mara and Mondrem were a hunting forest of the Norman Earls of Chester, established soon after 1071 by the first earl, Hugh d'Avranches. They might earlier have been an Anglo-Saxon hunting forest.

The Shōgitai took a large part in the battles of the Boshin war, especially at the Battle of Toba-Fushimi, and the Battle of Ueno, where they were nearly exterminated.\n","quest The Shōgitai were an elite corps of which shogunate?\n","truth Tokugawa shogunate\n","pred tokugawa shogunate ended\n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"stream","text":["\n"," 36%|███▌      | 2506/6935 [02:31<04:54, 15.02it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 36%|███▌      | 2508/6935 [02:31<04:51, 15.21it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 36%|███▌      | 2510/6935 [02:31<04:47, 15.40it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 36%|███▌      | 2512/6935 [02:32<04:43, 15.59it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 36%|███▋      | 2514/6935 [02:32<05:02, 14.60it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 36%|███▋      | 2516/6935 [02:32<05:15, 14.02it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 36%|███▋      | 2518/6935 [02:32<05:15, 14.01it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 36%|███▋      | 2520/6935 [02:32<05:09, 14.26it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 36%|███▋      | 2522/6935 [02:32<05:00, 14.68it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 36%|███▋      | 2524/6935 [02:32<04:51, 15.14it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 36%|███▋      | 2526/6935 [02:32<04:47, 15.31it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 36%|███▋      | 2528/6935 [02:33<04:41, 15.66it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 36%|███▋      | 2530/6935 [02:33<04:47, 15.30it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2532/6935 [02:33<04:42, 15.56it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2534/6935 [02:33<04:45, 15.40it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2536/6935 [02:33<04:44, 15.47it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2538/6935 [02:33<04:47, 15.28it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2540/6935 [02:33<04:44, 15.44it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2542/6935 [02:34<04:36, 15.87it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2544/6935 [02:34<04:30, 16.21it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2546/6935 [02:34<04:40, 15.64it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2548/6935 [02:34<04:39, 15.68it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2550/6935 [02:34<04:39, 15.70it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2552/6935 [02:34<04:35, 15.94it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2554/6935 [02:34<04:31, 16.14it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2556/6935 [02:34<04:29, 16.27it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2558/6935 [02:34<04:27, 16.37it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2560/6935 [02:35<04:28, 16.31it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2562/6935 [02:35<04:39, 15.63it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2564/6935 [02:35<04:43, 15.43it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2566/6935 [02:35<04:40, 15.60it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2568/6935 [02:35<04:56, 14.72it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2570/6935 [02:35<04:52, 14.91it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2572/6935 [02:35<04:44, 15.34it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2574/6935 [02:36<04:42, 15.45it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2576/6935 [02:36<04:36, 15.77it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2578/6935 [02:36<04:49, 15.05it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2580/6935 [02:36<04:48, 15.12it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2582/6935 [02:36<04:45, 15.22it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2584/6935 [02:36<04:39, 15.57it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2586/6935 [02:36<04:36, 15.74it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2588/6935 [02:36<04:43, 15.33it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2590/6935 [02:37<04:47, 15.11it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2592/6935 [02:37<04:47, 15.13it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2594/6935 [02:37<04:44, 15.28it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2596/6935 [02:37<04:41, 15.43it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2598/6935 [02:37<04:47, 15.10it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 37%|███▋      | 2600/6935 [02:37<04:43, 15.31it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 38%|███▊      | 2602/6935 [02:37<04:42, 15.33it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 38%|███▊      | 2604/6935 [02:38<04:42, 15.33it/s]\u001b[A"],"name":"stderr"},{"output_type":"stream","text":["context The Cleveland Browns season was the team's 64th season as a professional sports franchise and its 60th season as a member of the National Football League (NFL).

Published in two volumes, in 1605 and 1615, \"Don Quixote\" is considered the most influential work of literature from the Spanish Golden Age and the entire Spanish literary canon. As a founding work of modern Western literature and one of the earliest canonical novels, it regularly appears high on lists of the greatest works of fiction ever published, such as the Bokklubben World Library collection that cites \"Don Quixote\" as the authors' choice for the \"best literary work ever written\".Alexander Gorsky (August 6, 1871 – 1924), a Russian ballet choreographer and a contemporary of Marius Petipa, is known for restaging Petipa’s classical ballets such as \"Swan Lake\", \"Don Quixote\", and \"The Nutcracker\". Gorsky “sought greater naturalism, realism, and characterization” in ballet. He valued acting skills over \"bravura\" technique ( a showy display of skills such as many turns or high jumps.) His interpretations of ballets were often controversial and he often used artists outside the dance world to create sets and costumes.\n","quest What Russian ballet choreographer restaged a play based on a Spanish novel by Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra? \n","truth Alexander Gorsky\n","pred alexander gorsky (\n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"stream","text":["\n"," 42%|████▏     | 2906/6935 [02:57<04:15, 15.75it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 42%|████▏     | 2908/6935 [02:57<04:17, 15.64it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 42%|████▏     | 2910/6935 [02:57<04:15, 15.74it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 42%|████▏     | 2912/6935 [02:57<04:21, 15.41it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 42%|████▏     | 2914/6935 [02:57<04:14, 15.82it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 42%|████▏     | 2916/6935 [02:57<04:12, 15.89it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 42%|████▏     | 2918/6935 [02:58<04:10, 16.03it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 42%|████▏     | 2920/6935 [02:58<04:12, 15.88it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 42%|████▏     | 2922/6935 [02:58<04:14, 15.77it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 42%|████▏     | 2924/6935 [02:58<04:12, 15.87it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 42%|████▏     | 2926/6935 [02:58<04:19, 15.48it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 42%|████▏     | 2928/6935 [02:58<04:24, 15.16it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 42%|████▏     | 2930/6935 [02:58<04:18, 15.48it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 42%|████▏     | 2932/6935 [02:58<04:14, 15.72it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 42%|████▏     | 2934/6935 [02:59<04:12, 15.87it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 42%|████▏     | 2936/6935 [02:59<04:06, 16.24it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 42%|████▏     | 2938/6935 [02:59<04:06, 16.21it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 42%|████▏     | 2940/6935 [02:59<04:17, 15.49it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 42%|████▏     | 2942/6935 [02:59<04:17, 15.52it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 42%|████▏     | 2944/6935 [02:59<04:19, 15.37it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 42%|████▏     | 2946/6935 [02:59<04:14, 15.67it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2948/6935 [02:59<04:10, 15.93it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2950/6935 [03:00<04:08, 16.06it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2952/6935 [03:00<04:09, 15.97it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2954/6935 [03:00<04:07, 16.05it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2956/6935 [03:00<04:06, 16.14it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2958/6935 [03:00<04:04, 16.24it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2960/6935 [03:00<04:08, 15.99it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2962/6935 [03:00<04:06, 16.14it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2964/6935 [03:00<04:03, 16.31it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2966/6935 [03:01<03:59, 16.54it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2968/6935 [03:01<04:00, 16.50it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2970/6935 [03:01<04:05, 16.12it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2972/6935 [03:01<04:06, 16.07it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2974/6935 [03:01<04:09, 15.89it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2976/6935 [03:01<04:14, 15.56it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2978/6935 [03:01<04:08, 15.89it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2980/6935 [03:01<04:08, 15.94it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2982/6935 [03:02<04:06, 16.05it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2984/6935 [03:02<04:02, 16.30it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2986/6935 [03:02<04:08, 15.91it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2988/6935 [03:02<04:08, 15.90it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2990/6935 [03:02<04:11, 15.72it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2992/6935 [03:02<04:17, 15.29it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2994/6935 [03:02<04:13, 15.52it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2996/6935 [03:02<04:08, 15.88it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 2998/6935 [03:03<04:01, 16.27it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 3000/6935 [03:03<04:03, 16.19it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 3002/6935 [03:03<04:05, 16.01it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 43%|████▎     | 3004/6935 [03:03<04:03, 16.14it/s]\u001b[A"],"name":"stderr"},{"output_type":"stream","text":["context Shrek 2 is a 2004 American computer-animated fantasy film produced by DreamWorks Animation and directed by Andrew Adamson, Kelly Asbury and Conrad Vernon.

He was murdered in 1969 by killers hired by a union political opponent, Mine Workers president Tony Boyle. His death led to significant reforms in the union.The United Mine Workers of America (UMW or UMWA) is a North American labor union best known for representing coal miners. Today, the Union also represents health care workers, truck drivers, manufacturing workers and public employees in the United States and Canada. Although its main focus has always been on workers and their rights, the UMW of today also advocates for better roads, schools, and universal health care. By 2014, coal mining had largely shifted to open pit mines in Wyoming, and there were only 60,000 active coal miners.

He was also a highly influential writer and chess theoretician.The concept of a world chess champion started to emerge in the first half of the 19th century, and the phrase \"world champion\" appeared in 1845. From this time onwards various players were \"acclaimed\" as world champions, but the first contest that was defined \"in advance\" as being for the world championship was the match between Steinitz and Zukertort in 1886. Until 1948 world championship contents were matches arranged privately between the players. As a result, the players also had to arrange the funding, in the form of stakes provided by enthusiasts who wished to bet on one of the players. In the early 20th century this was sometimes a barrier that prevent or delayed challenges for the title.\n","quest Which Austrian and later American chess master who was also a highly influential writer and chess theoretician competed for the first contest  that was defined \"in advance\" as being for the world championship?\n","truth Steinitz\n","pred wilhelm ( later william ) steinitz (\n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"stream","text":["\n"," 64%|██████▎   | 4406/6935 [04:31<02:43, 15.48it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▎   | 4408/6935 [04:31<02:38, 15.96it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▎   | 4410/6935 [04:31<02:37, 16.05it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▎   | 4412/6935 [04:31<02:37, 16.00it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▎   | 4414/6935 [04:31<02:36, 16.10it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▎   | 4416/6935 [04:32<02:33, 16.40it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▎   | 4418/6935 [04:32<02:34, 16.29it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▎   | 4420/6935 [04:32<02:35, 16.22it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4422/6935 [04:32<02:41, 15.60it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4424/6935 [04:32<02:47, 14.95it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4426/6935 [04:32<02:49, 14.81it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4428/6935 [04:32<02:46, 15.07it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4430/6935 [04:32<02:39, 15.71it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4432/6935 [04:33<02:37, 15.93it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4434/6935 [04:33<02:35, 16.06it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4436/6935 [04:33<02:35, 16.03it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4438/6935 [04:33<02:38, 15.75it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4440/6935 [04:33<02:41, 15.46it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4442/6935 [04:33<02:36, 15.90it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4444/6935 [04:33<02:37, 15.78it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4446/6935 [04:33<02:36, 15.87it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4448/6935 [04:34<02:33, 16.18it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4450/6935 [04:34<02:33, 16.15it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4452/6935 [04:34<02:33, 16.16it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4454/6935 [04:34<02:36, 15.81it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4456/6935 [04:34<02:34, 16.03it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4458/6935 [04:34<02:36, 15.80it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4460/6935 [04:34<02:38, 15.64it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4462/6935 [04:34<02:35, 15.92it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4464/6935 [04:35<02:33, 16.06it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4466/6935 [04:35<02:33, 16.09it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4468/6935 [04:35<02:33, 16.08it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4470/6935 [04:35<02:38, 15.60it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 64%|██████▍   | 4472/6935 [04:35<02:40, 15.39it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 65%|██████▍   | 4474/6935 [04:35<02:37, 15.67it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 65%|██████▍   | 4476/6935 [04:35<02:36, 15.69it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 65%|██████▍   | 4478/6935 [04:35<02:35, 15.84it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 65%|██████▍   | 4480/6935 [04:36<02:33, 15.99it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 65%|██████▍   | 4482/6935 [04:36<02:35, 15.79it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 65%|██████▍   | 4484/6935 [04:36<02:34, 15.83it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 65%|██████▍   | 4486/6935 [04:36<02:38, 15.47it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 65%|██████▍   | 4488/6935 [04:36<02:41, 15.16it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 65%|██████▍   | 4490/6935 [04:36<02:37, 15.51it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 65%|██████▍   | 4492/6935 [04:36<02:35, 15.75it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 65%|██████▍   | 4494/6935 [04:36<02:30, 16.24it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 65%|██████▍   | 4496/6935 [04:37<02:31, 16.15it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 65%|██████▍   | 4498/6935 [04:37<02:31, 16.14it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 65%|██████▍   | 4500/6935 [04:37<02:30, 16.15it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 65%|██████▍   | 4502/6935 [04:37<02:36, 15.55it/s]\u001b[A\n"," 65%|██████▍   | 4504/6935 [04:37<02:40, 15.17it/s]\u001b[A"],"name":"stderr"},{"output_type":"stream","text":["context Lantern Waste is a fictional place in \"The Chronicles of Narnia\" series by C.

The lamppost in the wood is an iconic image of Narnia, and the question of its origin is what convinced Lewis to write more than one book on Narnia. One of King Edmund's titles is \"Duke of Lantern Waste\".Tumnus is a fictional character in C. S. Lewis' series \"The Chronicles of Narnia\". He is featured prominently in \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\" and also appears in \"The Horse and His Boy\" and \"The Last Battle\". He is close friends with Lucy Pevensie and is the first creature she meets in Narnia, as well as the first Narnian to be introduced in the series. Lewis said that the first Narnia story, \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\", all came to him from a single picture he had in his head of a faun carrying an umbrella and parcels through a snowy wood.

The targets are filled with explosives at ranges from 375 to . Shooters are allowed to engage as many targets as they are able during the all-day event. Nearly every year the amount of explosives has increased; in 2004, the amount of explosives put out for people to shoot was greater than all of the other years combined. In 2005, new targets were introduced with smaller amounts of explosives to reduce window breakage in the surrounding countryside. In recent years, the event has also featured an explosive fireball and an Anvil firing to start the event and entertain the participants.Anvil firing (also known in the USA as an \"anvil launching\" or an \"anvil shooting\") in the USA is the practice of firing an anvil into the air with gunpowder. In the UK this is where black powder is filled onto the top of the Anvil and ignited.

In the episode, to earn money for her husband Homer's snoring problem, Marge agrees to stay with her old prom date, Artie Ziff, for one weekend (on the grounds that he try not to grope her like he did in \"The Way We Was\"), but when Homer thinks Marge broke her promise, he runs away with Lenny to work on an oil rig.\"The Way We Was\" is the twelfth episode of \"The Simpsons\"<nowiki>'</nowiki> second season. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 31, 1991. In the episode, Marge tells the story of how she and Homer first met and fell in love. Flashing back to 1974, we see how Homer falls in love with Marge in high school and tries to get close to her by enlisting her as his French tutor.

The group consists of singer/keyboardist Damon Albarn, guitarist/singer Graham Coxon, bassist Alex James and drummer Dave Rowntree. Their debut album \"Leisure\" (1991) incorporated the sounds of Madchester and shoegazing. Following a stylistic change influenced by English guitar pop groups such as the Kinks, the Beatles and XTC, Blur released \"Modern Life Is Rubbish\" (1993), \"Parklife\" (1994) and \"The Great Escape\" (1995). In the process, the band became central to the Britpop music and culture movement, and achieved mass popularity in the UK, aided by a chart battle with rivals Oasis in 1995 dubbed the \"Battle of Britpop\".Big Pig were an Australian funk, rock and pop band that existed from 1985 to 1991.

He had an outwardly reserved character and did not court popularity either with his superiors or with the public. His American superior, General Dwight D.
